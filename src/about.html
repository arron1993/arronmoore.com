    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p>
        I was born in the United Kingdom, specifically in Grimsby, well
        actually a small village outside Grimsby called Laceby, but its easier
        to just say Grimsby.

        When I was 18 I moved to Nottingham to study Computer Science at Nottingham
        Trent University.

        After completing my Computer Science BSc I decided to stay an extra year at
        the university to complete an MSc also in Computer Science. I enjoyed the topics
        range of topics covered at undergrad and wanted to progress that knowledge
        further.
