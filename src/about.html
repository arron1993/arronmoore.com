<h2> About Me </h2>
<p> I was born in the United Kingdom, specifically in Grimsby. </p>
<p>
    When I was 18 I moved to Nottingham to study Computer Science at Nottingham
    Trent University.
</p>
<p>
    After completing my Computer Science BSc I decided to stay an extra year at
    the university to complete an MSc also in Computer Science. I enjoyed the topics
    range of topics covered at undergrad and wanted to progress that knowledge
    further.
